### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My Name is **Rojan Maharjan**.I am, essentially, a curious data-driven software engineer with dreams to carve out a career path that allows me to utilize and expand my skillset as a Data Engineer, Data Scientist and ML Engineer. Right from childhood, I have had a deep-seated interest in automating things. Once, when a family member got seriously injured at a high-risk job, I remember wondering why no one thought about getting such risk-prone jobs done by a machine. My foray into the field of Computer Science has been to broaden my knowledge about intelligent systems. I am very good at Math and Statistics. I also thoroughly enjoy working with diverse Machine Learning models. The best part is converting a hypothetical model created on a whiteboard to an actual coding of the model.
